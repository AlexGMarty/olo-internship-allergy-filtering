Presentation slides and screen captures from engineering internship capstone project.

Our goal was the create the capability to filter a restaurant's online menu based on the user's dietary needs, 
removing menu items from the page if they contained ingredients the user indicates they can't eat.

The files in this repo demo this functionality in action using real menu data. All code belongs to Olo.

There's also a video-only demo of the filtering functionality shown in this YouTube video:
